# OVA — On View Animations

**OVA** is a lightweight JavaScript library that animates HTML elements as they enter the viewport. It requires no dependencies and is built on the native [IntersectionObserver API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API).

## How it works

Add a `data-ova` attribute to any HTML element. When that element scrolls into view, OVA automatically triggers its animation. No JavaScript configuration required — everything is controlled via HTML attributes.

```html
<div data-ova="animation: fade-top; duration: 800ms; delay: 200ms">
  <h1>Hello World</h1>
</div>
```

## **Features**

- 🪶 **Lightweight** — one JS file and one CSS file, no dependencies
- ⚡ **Performant** — uses `IntersectionObserver` and stops observing after the animation fires
- 🎨 **Customizable** — control animation, duration, easing, delay and offset per element
- 🔌 **Flexible** — available as Vanilla JS bundle, ESM with bundled CSS, or ESM with separate CSS
- ✏️ **Extensible** — add your own custom animations with plain CSS

## **Browser support**

OVA relies on the `IntersectionObserver` API, which is supported by all modern browsers. Internet Explorer is not supported.

## **License**

OVA is released under the [**MIT License**](https://github.com/TUO-USERNAME/TUO-REPO/blob/main/LICENSE).
